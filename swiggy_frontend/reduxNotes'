redux = store(single sorce of truth / like an absolute judge)

store has slices(eg: user product)
redux only works on data layer (ie, ui pe  render nhi krega, only manages data)
ui->action dispatch on onchange event -> reducer function is dispatched to  make changes inn store -> selector to make changes on ui(selctor has access to store and display on ui) and process is called subscribing
